💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:

   1. Focus on GitHub, Product Hunt, Hacker News
      These platforms have higher public email exposure

   2. Integrate Hunter.io lookups for social media users
      Use names/usernames to find emails via Hunter.io API

   3. Reduce batch sizes for social platforms
      If keeping Reddit/YouTube/Instagram, search less users

   4. Fix campaign stalling issue
      Investigate why campaign stopped after batch 4
