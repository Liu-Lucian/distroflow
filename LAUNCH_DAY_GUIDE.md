Great question! Key differences from [competitor]:

• Open source - full control over your data

That said, [competitor] is great if you want a fully-hosted solution!

Different tools for different needs 😊

## Emergency Protocols

### If Server Crashes
**Problem**: API server or demo crashes during high traffic

**Solution**:
1. Post update: "Experiencing high traffic! Working on fix."
2. Quick fix if possible
3. If not, post workaround
4. Update when fixed: "Fixed! Thanks for patience."

### If Critical Bug Found
**Problem**: Major bug discovered during launch

**Solution**:
1. Acknowledge immediately
2. Create GitHub issue
3. Fix ASAP (within 1-2 hours)
4. Post update when fixed
5. Thank reporter publicly

### If Getting Downvoted
**Problem**: HN or Reddit post getting downvoted

**Solution**:
1. Review post for tone (too salesy?)
2. Engage genuinely in comments
3. Don't argue or defend
4. Accept feedback and learn
5. Consider relaunch with better messaging

### If No Traction
**Problem**: Low engagement, few upvotes

**Solution**:
1. Don't panic - first launch rarely perfect
2. Analyze what's not resonating
3. Gather feedback from soft launch
4. Plan improved relaunch in 1-2 weeks
5. Focus on building product in meantime
